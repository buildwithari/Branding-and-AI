## How to Choose Your Project
 
**Ask yourself**:
 
**1. What marketing problem frustrates you?**  
Think about inefficiencies you've seen. Manual processes. Time-consuming tasks. Decisions made on gut feeling instead of data.
 
**2. What skills do you want to showcase?**
- Technical depth? Build something with complex data processing.
- Automation? Build workflow orchestration.
- Analysis? Build intelligence/reporting tools.
- Full-stack? Build tools with user interfaces.
 
**3. What data is accessible?**
- Social media APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn have good free tiers)
- Web scraping (any public website)
- Synthetic data (you can generate test data)
- Open datasets (many marketing datasets available)
 
**4. Can you ship an MVP in 3 weeks?**
Be honest. If it requires custom AI training, complicated infrastructure, or 10 different integrations—too big for Week 3.

## Writing Your Project Proposal
 
**Format**: 150-200 words
 
**Structure**:
 
**1. What will you work on?** (1-2 sentences)  
Be specific. "Improve social media analysis" is vague. "Build a competitor social monitoring tool that tracks 5 competitors' posts, identifies trending topics, and alerts when competitors post about key industry terms" is specific.
 
**2. Why is this valuable?** (2-3 sentences)  
Explain the real-world problem. Use numbers if possible. "Marketing teams spend 5-10 hours per week manually checking competitor social accounts. They miss trending topics because they can't monitor 24/7."
 
**3. What skills will you gain?** (2-3 sentences)  
List specific technical skills. "I'll learn n8n for workflow automation, Twitter and LinkedIn API integration, sentiment analysis, and automated alerting systems."
 
**4. How does this apply to marketing/branding challenges?** (2-3 sentences)  
Connect to actual marketing needs. "This addresses the challenge of competitive intelligence at scale. Marketing teams can't monitor competitors 24/7, so they miss opportunities to join conversations or respond to competitive moves."
 
**Pro Tip**: Use action verbs. You're not "exploring" or "studying"—you're developing, implementing, designing, building.

**Why**: When you add this to your resume, those action verbs matter.
