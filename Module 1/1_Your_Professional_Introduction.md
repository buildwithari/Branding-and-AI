# Part 1: Your Professional Introduction

![Part 1 Introduction Hero](assets/1-hero.png)

## The Challenge
 
Create a professional introduction that:
- Shows who you are **right now**
- Hints at where you're **going**
- Demonstrates what makes you **unique**
- Positions you in the **AI + Branding space**
 
## Why This Matters
 
Your professional introduction is how you'll open every conversation:
- Networking events
- Job interviews 
- LinkedIn connections
- Cold emails
- Conference introductions
 
Most people get this wrong. They either:
- Over-explain (bore people with your life story)
- Under-explain (generic "I'm a student interested in AI")
- Miss the point (list skills without showing value)
 
**Your goal**: Create an introduction so clear and compelling that people immediately understand your value.

## What to Include
 
**1. Current Background**
Where are you now? What's your foundation?
 
❌ **Bad**: "I'm a graduate student at Northeastern."   
✅ **Good**: "I'm an information systems grad student with 3 years of product management experience at B2B SaaS companies."
 
**Why it works**: Specific, positions you with real experience, immediately signals your domain.
 
**2. Career Aspirations (2-3 Year Vision)**
Where are you going? What's your target?
 
❌ **Bad**: "I want to work in AI."   
✅ **Good**: "I'm positioning myself to lead AI product strategy at growth-stage startups in the marketing tech space."
 
**Why it works**: Specific role, specific type of company, specific domain. Someone can now help you.
 
**3. Why AI and Branding**
What's your unique angle?
 
❌ **Bad**: "AI is the future and branding is important."   
✅ **Good**: "I saw marketing teams spending 20 hours per week on manual social media monitoring—work AI can automate. That gap is my opportunity."
 
**Why it works**: Specific problem, clear insight, shows you understand the intersection.
 
**4. Your Unique Perspective**
What do you bring that others don't?
 
❌ **Bad**: "I'm a hard worker who learns fast."   
✅ **Good**: "I spent two years in customer success, so I build AI tools that non-technical teams actually want to use."
 
**Why it works**: Specific background, clear advantage, shows strategic thinking.

**5. Technical Skills (3-5)**
What can you actually do?
 
**Pro Tip**: Include both technical terms AND plain language. Why?
- **For humans**: Plain language helps anyone understand
- **For ATS systems**: Technical terms help you get found
- **For AI tools**: Both matter for search and recommendations
 
Example:
- Machine Learning (ML) - predictive modeling and pattern recognition
- Python - data analysis and automation
- ChatGPT/Claude - AI-powered content generation and workflow optimization

## Creating Your Visual Introduction
 
**Platform**: Figma (it's free, industry-standard, and you'll use it all semester)
 
**What Makes It Work**:
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important info = biggest/first
2. **Professional Photo**: Not a selfie. Not a group photo. You, professional background, good lighting.
3. **Balanced Layout**: Don't cram. White space = professional.
4. **Brand Consistent**: Choose 2-3 colors. Stick with them. This is the start of YOUR brand.
 
**The Format**:
```
[YOUR PHOTO] [YOUR NAME] [Your One-Line Position]
Current: [Background]
Vision: [2-3 year goal]

Why AI + Branding: [Your unique insight]

Skills: [Skill 1] | [Skill 2] | [Skill 3]
```
