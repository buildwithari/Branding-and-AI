## Why This Matters
 
You can't build professional work without professional tools. Setting everything up properly now saves you hours of frustration later.
 
## Design & Development Tools
 
**1. Figma (Free)**
- Industry-standard design tool
- You'll use it for: assignments, portfolio work, presentations
- **Action**: Create account with NEU email (get 3 free boards)
- **Pro Tip**: Join the class workspace (link in Canvas)
 
**2. Adobe Creative Cloud (Free for NEU students)**
- Professional design suite
- You'll use: Adobe Express, Photoshop (maybe), Illustrator (maybe)
- **Action**: Get it through Northeastern IT
- **Reality Check**: Most of your work will be in Figma/Canva, but having Adobe = professional backup
 
**3. GitHub**
- Where your Madison work lives
- Industry-standard for code collaboration
- **Action**: Create account, set up profile, star the Madison repo
- **Pro Tip**: Use your real name and professional photo—recruiters look at GitHub

## Professional Platform Tools
 
**4. LinkedIn**
- Your professional networking hub
- **Action**: Optimize your custom URL (linkedin.com/in/yourname)
- **Why**: Clean URL = professional. Random numbers = amateur.
- **Pro Tip**: Reserve your URL even if you don't finish your profile yet
 
**5. Resume Tools**
- **Action**: Create free Jobscan.co account
- **Why**: You'll use this to optimize your resume for ATS systems
- **Reality**: 75% of resumes never reach human eyes—they're filtered by software
 
**6. AI Assistant (ChatGPT or Claude)**
- You'll use AI throughout this course
- **Action**: Create account (free tier is fine to start)
- **Pro Tip**: Learn to prompt well—it's a skill that matters

## Additional Recommended Tools
 
**7. Canva (Free)**

- **When to use**: Fast iterations, social media content
- **When not to use**: Complex design work (use Figma)
 
**8. Portfolio Platform**
- Options: Vercel v0, Framer AI, WIX, or custom site
- **Action**: Just explore for now, you'll choose later
- **Reality**: You'll build your portfolio in Week 9

## Professional Username Consistency
 
**The Mistake**: Different username on every platform
 
**The Fix**: Choose ONE professional username format and use it everywhere
 
**Good formats**:
- FirstLast (if available)
- FirstMiddleLast
- First.Last
- FirstLastProfession
 
**Bad formats**:
- Coolname123
- Nicknames
- Inside jokes
- Random words

**Why it matters**: Consistent usernames = easy to find = professional.

**Your Deliverable**: Screenshot each setup
 
**Why**: Proves you did it, and you'll reference these later
 
**What to capture**:
- Account created confirmation
- Profile page
- Settings showing professional username
- Workspace joined (for Figma)
