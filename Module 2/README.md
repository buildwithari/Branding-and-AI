## Build Like a Product Manager

![Hero Image](assets/hero.png)

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Identify your target job and analyze the skills gap between you and that role
- Write a Product Requirements Document (PRD) like tech companies use
- Design a multi-agent AI architecture for your Madison project
- Define realistic MVP scope that you can actually build
- Make strategic technical decisions with clear rationale

**Time Investment**: 8-10 hours
**Deliverable**: A comprehensive PRD on Figma that anyone could build from

## Why This Matters

Most students jump straight into coding. They:
- Build the wrong thing
- Realize halfway through it won't work
- Have no clear success criteria
- Can't explain their decisions
- End up with nothing to show

**The professionals?** They spend time planning. They:
- Know exactly what they're building and why
- Can defend their technical decisions
- Have clear milestones and success metrics
- Ship on time because they planned for reality
- Have documentation that impresses employers

**This chapter makes you a professional.**

## The 80/20 Philosophy in Action

**The Reality**: In the real world, 80% of success is shipping something that works.

**The Other 20%**: Polish, insight, and that extra mile—that's what beats your competition.

This week, you're learning to plan like a professional product manager. Not because planning is fun (it's not), but because:

1. **Good planning = faster building**
2. **Clear requirements = less wasted time**
3. **PRDs get you hired** (seriously, recruiters love seeing this skill)

## Your Figma Board Deliverable

### What You're Creating

A professional Product Requirements Document on Figma that includes:

**1. Dream Job Analysis**
- Specific job posting (company + title)
- Link or screenshot
- Top 3 technical requirements
- Why this role interests you

**2. Gap Analysis Table**
- What they want vs. what you have
- Specific gaps to fill
- How Madison project addresses each gap
- Connection to your career goals

**3. Product Requirements Document**
- Problem Statement (who, what, cost of not solving)
- Proposed Solution (your Madison approach)
- User Stories (3 specific use cases)
- Success Metrics (measurable outcomes)

**4. Technical Architecture**
- Agent Design (3-5 specialized agents with specific jobs)
- Agent Communication (how they pass data)
- MVP Scope (what you WILL build)
- What's NOT in MVP (scope control)

### Board Standards

**Organization**:
- Clear section headers
- Logical flow
- Related items grouped
- Easy to navigate

**Visual Styling**:
- Consistent colors (2-3 max)
- Consistent fonts (1-2 max)
- Professional appearance
- Clean layout

**Professional Presentation**:
- No spelling errors
- No placeholder text
- Specific examples (not vague)
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Sharing**:
- Link with view/comment permissions
- Test the link before submitting
- Make sure nothing is private

## Success Criteria

You'll know you've succeeded when:

✅ Someone could read your PRD and build your exact project
✅ Your gap analysis connects directly to your target job
✅ Your architecture is specific enough to start implementing
✅ Your scope is realistic for the implementation phase
✅ Your PRD looks professional enough to show in a job interview

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall #1: Vague Job Selection
**Symptom**: "I want to work in AI" or "marketing jobs"
**Fix**: Find ONE specific job posting. Company name. Exact title. Real requirements.

### Pitfall #2: Unrealistic Gap Analysis
**Symptom**: "I have none of these skills" or "I have all these skills"
**Fix**: Be honest. You probably have 40-60% of requirements. That's normal.

### Pitfall #3: Generic Problem Statements
**Symptom**: "Marketing is hard" or "Companies need better tools"
**Fix**: Specific company type, specific problem, quantified cost.

### Pitfall #4: Too Ambitious Architecture
**Symptom**: 8 agents, 5 APIs, custom ML models
**Fix**: 3-4 agents max for MVP. Use existing APIs. Ship something that works.

### Pitfall #5: No Scope Control
**Symptom**: "I'll build everything and see what works"
**Fix**: Be brutally clear about what's NOT in MVP. Scope creep kills projects.

## Pro Tips from the Instructors

**From Nina (40 years in creative)**:

> "Your PRD is a creative brief for your technical work. If you can't explain the problem and solution clearly, you'll build the wrong thing. Great products come from great planning. Messy planning = messy products."

**From Nik (AI engineering)**:

> "The agent architecture isn't about complexity—it's about clarity. Each agent should have ONE job. If you can't explain what an agent does in one sentence, it's doing too much. Simple, modular, focused."

**On Scope**:

> "Most students want to build everything. That's ego. Professionals ship the MVP, learn from it, then iterate. Your initial build should prove your concept works. Additional features come after you validate the core functionality."

**On Gap Analysis**:

> "The gap analysis is your semester curriculum. Every skill gap you identify? That's something your Madison project should teach you. If your project doesn't close at least 3 gaps, pick a different project."

## Tools & Resources

### For Job Research
- **LinkedIn Jobs**: Best for established companies
- **Indeed**: Broad coverage
- **AngelList**: Startups
- **Y Combinator Jobs**: High-growth startups
- **Company Career Pages**: Direct from source

### For Writing PRDs
- **Templates**: Google "Product Requirements Document template"
- **Examples**: Look at open-source project RFCs and PRDs
- **AI Assistance**: Use ChatGPT to refine your problem statements
- **Loom**: "How to Write a PRD" (Product School)

### For Architecture Design
- **Madison Repository**: https://github.com/Humanitariansai/Madison

## Next Steps

Once you complete your planning:

1. **Submit your Figma PRD** (link in Canvas)
2. **Review feedback** from your TA and peers
3. **Prepare for implementation**: You'll actually build your Madison project

Remember: This planning work saves you hours of wasted development time. The students who rush past this? They rebuild 2-3 times. The students who plan well? They ship on the first try.

**The students who nail this chapter?** They have a crystal-clear roadmap and start building with confidence.

**The students who skip this chapter?** They code for a week, realize it's the wrong approach, and start over.

Which one will you be?
