# Part 1: Pick Your Lane (Dream Job Analysis)

![Hero Image](assets/part1-hero.png)

## The Challenge
 
Find ONE real job posting you could apply for in 6-12 months. Not 5 years from now. Not "someday." A real job you could actually get with the skills you'll have by summer.
 
## Why This Matters
 
Everything you build this semester should point toward a specific role. Not "working in AI" (too vague). A specific position at a specific type of company.
 
**Without a target**:
- You build random things
- Your portfolio lacks focus
- You can't tell a coherent story
- Recruiters don't know where you fit
 
**With a target**:
- Every project proves a relevant skill
- Your portfolio tells a clear story
- You can explain exactly why you're qualified
- Recruiters immediately see the fit

## Finding Your Target Job
 
**Where to Look**:
- **LinkedIn Jobs**: Best for established companies
- **Indeed**: Broad coverage, good for comparing requirements
- **AngelList**: Startups and growth-stage companies
- **Y Combinator Jobs**: High-growth startups
- **Company Career Pages**: Direct from source
 
**What to Look For**:
 
**1. Timeline Check**
Can you realistically qualify in 6-12 months?
 
❌ **Too Senior**: "5+ years experience, managed teams of 10+"   
✅ **Right Level**: "0-2 years experience" or "New grad role" or "Early career"
 
**2. Skill Alignment**
Do you have 50%+ of the required skills?
 
❌ **Too Far**: You have 1 out of 10 requirements   
✅ **Achievable Stretch**: You have 5-6 out of 10, can learn the rest
 
**3. Interest Check**
Would you actually want this job?
 
❌ **Purely Strategic**: Boring work you'd hate   
✅ **Genuinely Interesting**: Role you'd be excited to do
 
**4. Madison Connection**
Can your Madison project address a need in this role?
 
❌ **No Connection**: Role has nothing to do with your project
✅ **Clear Connection**: Your Madison project solves problems this role faces

## Your Deliverable
 
Post on your Figma board:
 
**1. Company + Exact Title**  
Be specific. "Marketing Automation Engineer at HubSpot" not "marketing job"
 
**Why**: Specific = you've done your research. Vague = you're guessing.
 
**2. Link or Screenshot**  
Actual job posting. Prove it's real.
 
**Why**: Forces you to work with real requirements, not imagined ones.
 
**3. Top 3 Technical Requirements**  
Copy them exactly from the posting.
 
**Examples**:
- "Experience with marketing automation tools (Zapier, n8n, or similar)"
- "Proven ability to work with APIs and data integration"
- "Python or JavaScript for building marketing tools"
 
**Why**: These are your gap analysis starting point.
 
**4. One Sentence: Why This Role?**  
What makes you interested?
 
❌ **Generic**: "It's a good company and the role sounds interesting"
✅ **Specific**: "I want to build AI-powered marketing automation tools that help teams scale without hiring, which is exactly what this role does"

## Excellence Level (Bonus Points)
 
**Find the Hiring Manager on LinkedIn**
 
**How**:
1. Find the company's page
2. Search "[Role] at [Company]" on LinkedIn
3. Look at who's in that department
4. Find who's likely hiring (Director/VP level)
 
**Learn About Them**:
- Their background
- Their recent posts/articles
- Their team's initiatives
- What they care about
 
**Why This Matters**:
- Shows initiative beyond basic requirements
- Helps you understand what they're really looking for
- Gives you talking points for networking/interviews
- Demonstrates research skills
 
**Example**:
"Hiring manager is Sarah Chen, VP of Marketing Operations at Acme. She previously led marketing ops at two other SaaS companies, recently posted about the challenge of scaling content production without losing quality, and her team just launched a new workflow automation initiative. My Madison project—a multi-platform content adapter—directly addresses the scaling problem she's discussing."
