# Part 2: Skills & Development Goals

![Part 2 Hero](assets/2-hero.png)

## The Reality Check
 
Most people think they know their skill level. They don't.
 
**The goal**: Honest self-assessment + market-aware development plan
 
## How to Rate Yourself (1-5 Scale)
 
**1 - Aware**: You know it exists and what it's for 
**2 - Beginner**: You've used it, understand basics 
**3 - Competent**: You can complete tasks independently 
**4 - Proficient**: You can solve complex problems and teach others 
**5 - Expert**: You're creating new methods or leading in this area
 
**Pro Tip**: If you're a student, you're probably not a 5 in anything. That's okay. Claiming expertise you don't have = credibility killer.

## Market Awareness: What Employers Actually Want
 
**Your task**: Research 3-5 job postings in your target field.
 
**Where to look**:
- LinkedIn Jobs
- Indeed
- Company career pages
- AngelList (for startups)
- Y Combinator job board
 
**What to look for**:
1. **Technical requirements** (hard skills they need)
2. **Soft skills** (how they describe ideal candidates)
3. **Emerging technologies** (what's trending in postings)
4. **Experience level** (what 0-2 years vs. 2-5 years looks like)
 
**Document**:
- Which skills appear in 3+ postings (those are essential)
- Which skills are "nice to have" (those are differentiators)
- Which skills you're missing (those are your gap)

## Identify Your Three Development Areas
 
Pick 3 skills to focus on this semester. Here's how:
 
**Good priorities**:  
✅ Skills that appear in multiple job postings   
✅ Skills that complement your existing strengths   
✅ Skills you'll actually use in your Madison project   
✅ Skills with clear, measurable progress  
 
**Bad priorities**:  
❌ Skills that sound impressive but you don't need   
❌ Skills that are too broad ("get better at AI")   
❌ Skills that won't show up in your portfolio   
❌ Skills with no connection to your career goals
 
**Example**:  
***Area 1:*** N8N Workflow Automation  
*Why:* Appears in 4/5 marketing ops jobs. My Madison project will use it. Can show working examples.

***Area 2:*** API Integration & Data Processing  
*Why:* My target roles need "technical marketing" skills. Madison project requires pulling data from multiple sources. Can demonstrate through working tools.

***Area 3:*** Technical Writing
*Why:* Need to document my Madison contribution. Every job posting mentioned "communication skills." Improves my portfolio quality.
