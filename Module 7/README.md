## Welcome to Brand Identity

You've defined your brand strategy and positioning in Module 6. Now it's time to bring your brand to life visually. This module covers the visual elements that make your brand recognizable, memorable, and emotionally resonant.

Great brand identity isn't about pretty pictures. It's about visual systems that communicate your archetype, reinforce your positioning, and create instant recognition. From your logo to your color palette to your design wireframes, every visual choice should tell your brand story.

## Module Contents

### 📖 [Brand Archetypes — The Foundation](./Brand-Archetypes-The-Foundation.md)

Before you can create a visual identity, you need to understand the psychological foundation of your brand. This chapter explores Carl Jung's 12 archetypes and how they translate into modern branding.

**What You'll Learn:**
- The psychology behind why certain brands "feel right"
- The 12 brand archetypes and what each represents
- How to identify your brand's archetype
- Real-world examples from Nike, Google, Harley-Davidson, and more
- How to apply archetypes to personal branding for your job search

**Key Takeaway:** Your archetype is the North Star for all visual and messaging decisions. Once you know whether you're a Hero, Sage, Creator, or another archetype, your design choices become clear and consistent.

## Why This Module Matters

In the job market, your visual identity is often the first impression you make. A well-designed portfolio site, a professional logo, and a cohesive visual system signal that you:

1. **Understand design thinking** even if you're not a designer
2. **Take your personal brand seriously** and pay attention to details
3. **Can create compelling presentations** of your work
4. **Align visual choices with strategic thinking** from archetype to execution

The Madison Framework projects you build in Modules 1-5 need to be presented beautifully. This module gives you the visual toolkit to do exactly that.
