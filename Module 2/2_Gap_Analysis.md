![Hero Image](assets/part2-hero.png)

### The Uncomfortable Truth
 
You're not qualified for that job. Yet.
 
**That's okay.** The gap between where you are and where you want to be? That's your curriculum for the semester.
 
### Creating Your Gap Analysis Table

![Gap Analysis Table Image](assets/part2-table.png)

**The Format**:
 
| They Want | I Have | Gap to Fill | Madison Could Help By... |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| [Requirement] | [Current level] | [What's missing] | [How your project addresses it] |
 
### How to Fill It Out
 
**Column 1: They Want**  
Copy directly from the job posting. Exact words matter.
 
**Column 2: I Have**  
Be honest. What do you actually know?
 
**Rating Scale**:
- **None**: Never used it
- **Basic**: Used it, understand fundamentals
- **Intermediate**: Can work independently
- **Advanced**: Can solve complex problems
 
**Column 3: Gap to Fill**  
What's the specific gap?
 
Not: "Need to learn automation" 
But: "Need hands-on experience building and deploying multi-step workflows"
 
**Column 4: Madison Could Help By...**  
How your project fills this gap.
 
Not: "I'll learn it" 
But: "Building n8n workflows that scrape competitor social posts, analyze trends, and send automated alerts"

3. Search "[Company] tech stack" on Google
4. Check StackShare or similar sites
5. Look at what their engineers discuss on Twitter/LinkedIn
