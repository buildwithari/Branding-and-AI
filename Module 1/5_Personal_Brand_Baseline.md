# Part 5: Personal Brand Baseline

![Part 5 Hero](assets/5-hero.png)

## The Uncomfortable Truth
 
Right now, you probably:
- Have an incomplete LinkedIn profile
- Don't have a portfolio website 
- Haven't updated your resume in 6+ months
- Aren't consistent across platforms
- Don't have a clear professional story
 
**That's normal for students. But it won't get you hired.**

## Current State Assessment
 
**Your task**: Document where you are right now.
 
**1. Screenshot Your LinkedIn Profile**
Don't edit it yet. Just capture it as-is.
 
**Look for**:
- Missing sections (About, Experience, Skills)
- Generic headline ("Student at Northeastern")
- No banner image
- Limited connections
- No featured content
- No recommendations
 
**2. Document Your Current Web Presence**
- Personal website? (Most students: no)
- Portfolio? (Most students: no)
- GitHub? (Maybe, but probably sparse)
- Other platforms?
 
**3. Your Current Professional Story**
How do you answer "What do you do?"
 
Most students: "I'm a grad student studying information systems."
 
That's not a story. That's a fact. Your professional story needs to be:
- Clear (they understand in 10 seconds)
- Compelling (they want to know more)
- Credible (backed by real experience)
- Consistent (same across all platforms)
 
**4. Identify Enhancement Areas**
Where are the biggest gaps?
- Content gaps (missing information)
- Quality gaps (present but poor quality)
- Consistency gaps (different story on different platforms)
- Professional gaps (not job-search ready)

## Understanding Modern Professional Standards
 
**The Reality**:
- Resumes need to work for **both humans and ATS systems**
- Portfolios need to be **both creative and technically impressive**
- Professional presence needs to be **consistent across platforms**
- Keywords need to **align with job postings**
 
**What This Means**:
 
**For Resumes**:
- ATS-friendly version (clean, parseable, keyword-optimized)
- Visual version (branded, impressive, portfolio-quality)
- Both versions need to tell the same story
 
**For Portfolios**:
- Can't just be pretty—needs to show technical depth
- Can't just be technical—needs to show design thinking
- Must demonstrate both creative and analytical skills
 
**For Professional Presence**:
- LinkedIn = professional networking hub
- GitHub = technical credibility
- Personal site = controlled brand narrative
- All three should reinforce the same positioning

## Define Your Semester Goals
 
Create four specific goals:
 
**1. Technical Goal: Madison Framework**
What will you contribute?
 
❌ **Vague**: "Learn the Madison framework"   
✅ **Specific**: "Build and deploy a competitor social monitoring tool that tracks 5 competitors across Twitter/LinkedIn and identifies trending topics with 90%+ accuracy"
 
**2. Brand Goal: Your Professional Positioning**
What outcome do you want?
 
❌ **Vague**: "Improve my professional presence"   
✅ **Specific**: "Launch a portfolio website that positions me as an AI marketing technologist and generates at least 5 LinkedIn profile views from recruiters"
 
**3. Portfolio Goal: Demonstrable Capabilities**
What will showcase your skills?
 
❌ **Vague**: "Create a portfolio"   
✅ **Specific**: "Publish 3 case studies demonstrating my ability to build AI marketing tools, each with working demos and technical documentation"
 
**4. Network Goal: Strategic Connections**
Who do you want to connect with?
 
❌ **Vague**: "Network more"
✅ **Specific**: "Connect with 10 marketing ops professionals at growth-stage SaaS companies and have coffee chats with 3"

**The Secret**: Specific goals are achievable. Vague goals stay dreams.
